        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of the website is to increase the patient bookings in the coming months by enhancing online visibility and 
        clearly presenting the clinic’s services and promotion offers. It also aims to educate viewers on the importance of dental 
        health while fostering trust and long term relationships with clients</p>
        <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
        <p>The success of the website would be evaluated based on its ability to increase patient engagement and bookings online. 
        Key indicators include increased appointment requests and bookings done via the website, the volume of email inquiries generated
        via the contact page of the website, and the redemption rates of the promotions advertised on the website. Success is also
        further measured by user interaction with the educational content such as time spent on reading articles and patient feedback
        regarding the clarity and usefulness of the website. These metrics will help in determining whether the website has
         successfully achieved the clinic's goals of outreach, education and trust-building.</p>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience of this website is primarily adults who are responsible for the dental care of their families including children and the elderly. 
        They are likely on the lookout for a dental clinic that is trustworthy, experienced and able to offer comprehensive services for 
        all age groups. Given the long standing presence and wide service range of 100SMILES dental clinic, the audience is sure to be 
        drawn to the reputation and reliability of the clinic.</p> 
        <p>Design Intentions:</p>
        <p>To cater to the audience, the website will feature:</p>
        <p>A clean, professional layout using the turquoise and white color scheme to evoke calmness, trust and cleanliness.</p>
        <p>The navigation will be simple with the fonts being large and readable to ensure accessibility for the older users.</p>
        <p>Services will be prominently highlighted along with the staff bios to help build credibility.</p>
        <p>Educational content is to be displayed in a simple and scannable format to help adults easily share knowledge with children and/or elderly relatives</p>
        <p>Clear call-to-action and contact information makes booking appointments quick and easy</p>
